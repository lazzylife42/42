## 1. Introduction

The code files consist of the implementation of the `get_next_line` function, which reads lines from a file descriptor using a buffer, along with a set of supporting helper functions. These helper functions manage memory allocation, buffer manipulation, and line extraction, collectively contributing to the effective operation of the `get_next_line` mechanism.

## 2. Function List

### `char *get_next_line(int fd)`

This function reads lines from the specified file descriptor (`fd`). It utilizes a static buffer to store data between calls, and it uses helper functions to facilitate line-by-line reading. If the file descriptor is invalid or the buffer size is non-positive, it returns `NULL`.

### `ssize_t find_newline_index(char *buff)`

This function determines the index of the first newline character (`'\n'`) within the provided buffer. If no newline character is found, it returns `-1`, otherwise, it returns the index. This functionality aids in locating the end of lines within the buffer.

### `char *gnl_read(int fd, char *res)`

The `gnl_read` function reads data from the file descriptor (`fd`) and appends it to an existing result (`res`) while dynamically managing memory allocation. It reads data in chunks of `BUFFER_SIZE`, concatenates the buffer content with the result, and halts when a newline character is encountered. It returns the concatenated result.

### `char *gnl_get_line(char *buff)`

This function extracts a line from the provided buffer (`buff`). It identifies the newline character using the `find_newline_index` function and creates a dynamically allocated string containing the extracted line. If no further lines are present in the buffer, it returns `NULL`.

### `char *gnl_remove_old_line(char *buff)`

The `gnl_remove_old_line` function eliminates the first line from the buffer (`buff`) and returns the remaining content as a new buffer. If no newline character is found in the buffer, it returns `NULL`. It takes care of memory allocation, copying, and freeing of buffers.

## 3. Integration of Helper Functions

The `get_next_line` function seamlessly integrates the helper functions to achieve its purpose. By combining these functions, it enables efficient and effective line-based reading from file descriptors using a buffer.

## 4. Conclusion

This documentation provides insight into the `get_next_line` function and its associated helper functions. Understanding their collaborative roles is crucial for implementing an efficient and reliable line-reading mechanism using the `get_next_line` approach.
